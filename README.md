Word2Vec model for Vietnamese
- For Vietnamese:
	+ word2vec-visualization: I am testing the UI by quickly replacing English dict with a Vietnamese dict. It doesn't work already so there must be encoding problems. Feel free to test with vi_data_euclidean_skipgram_tiny.json/vi_data_cosine_skipgram_tiny.json.
	+ word2vec-simple-visualization: It is working well. Please read the readme file inside that folder to know how to test the model.
- For English and JP: Use the original project at https://github.com/pvthuy/word2vec-visualization
